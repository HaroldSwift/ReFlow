# ReFlow
A free and open source [Flow for Reddit](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.deeptrouble.yaarreddit) clone.

Aim of this project is to rebuild a reddit client that works exactly like [Flow for Reddit](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.deeptrouble.yaarreddit).


----------

Flow is a reddit client for android which is easy on resources, has small apk size and footprint, and has a great user experience. Flow's developer has stopped development and gone missing a year ago. There is no updates in the past year and there is no sign there will be. The goal of ReFlow is to create an app that is identical to Flow, fix the known bugs and add the missing features.

More details and a Google+ page will be added soon.
